# List of students

Repository for practicing doing pull requests.  Introduce yourself via a `USERNAME.txt` (or `USERNAME.md`) file under the directory for this term, and submit via pull request.

When you fork the repository, you'll automatically start "watching" it (and
thereby receiving emails whenever it gets updated). Ignore the repository on
GitHub to stop all the messages.
